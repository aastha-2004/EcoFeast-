# EcoFeast-
EcoFeast is a technology-driven platform designed to combat food waste and hunger in India by connecting surplus food donors, such as restaurants, hotels, and individuals, with NGOs and food banks. It leverages AI and ML for food categorization and demand prediction, while IoT sensors ensure food quality and safety. Route optimization minimizes transportation costs and improves efficiency, and real-time tracking enhances transparency. The user-friendly app makes food donation accessible to all demographics. EcoFeast also ensures compliance with food safety and legal regulations, preventing risks. By collaborating with NGOs, local governments, and businesses, it aims to create a scalable and sustainable food redistribution system that reduces waste and provides meals to the needy.
